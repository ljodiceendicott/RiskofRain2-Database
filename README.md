# Risk-of-Rain-2-Database
This project was made by using the data given to us(the public) by the developer of the game Risk of Rain 2, Hopoo Games. This program will allow users to get information about the items, playable characters and Enemies in the game. As well as allow them to track a log of each time they play the game, also known as a "run". This feature allows the user to make plug in how far they had gotten in a run as well as who they played as, and if they beat the game or what had killed them. There is also a feature that allows the user to add what ever notes they want to add. For Ex.(Something about the build they were going for, a log of all of the bosses they had, even the times that they had for each stage).
